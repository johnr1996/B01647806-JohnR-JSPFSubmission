        <div class="container-sm text-left">
          
          <p>For my fifth element, I have created a short game that involves the player controlling a character to push a ball around obstacles and into a goal. The element consists of three scenes:
            <br>1. Main Menu
            <br>2. Gameplay
            <br>3. Win Screen</p>
            <br><h1>Menu Scene</h1>
            <p>When the element is first opened, the Main Menu scene is displayed.
              This displays the game's name, plus a short description of what the
              player has to do. Below this description is the button to begin the game.
              There is also an acoustic drum soundtrack that plays in the background,
              and will loop for as long as this scene is open.</p>
              <img src="public/docpics/music.png" class="d-block w-50">
              <p>Pressing the 'Press to start!' button will load the Gameplay scene.</p>
              <img src="public/docpics/menupic.png" class="d-block w-50">
              <br>
              <br>
              <h1>Gameplay Scene</h1>
              <p>For my gameplay scene, I made a simple physics-based game where the player controls
                a character and has to push a ball around a small arena, avoiding obstacles and
                getting the ball into a goal.</p>
              <img src="public/docpics/gameplay.png" class="d-block w-100">
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Audio</h2>
              <p>When the scene is loaded, the menu music is disabled and replaced with a desert
                ambience looping effect. This sound helped to portray the desert environment
                appropriately, while also not getting jarring or annoying with a repetitive song.</p>
              <br>
              <h2>User Interface</h2>
              <p>The UI is displayed on the bottom left of the screen, and displays the game's
                controls to remind the player.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/uipic.png" class="d-block w-50">
              <br>
              <br>
              <h2>Camera</h2>
              <p>The player camera is locked in both its height and zoom levels,
                and can only be rotated and moved horizontally.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/camera.png" class="d-block w-30">
                <br>
                <br>
              <h2>Environment</h2>
              <p>The outer environment consists of rocky mountainous terrain, using a height map.
                This is used as the backdrop to the scene, and covers the disparity between the
                edge of the terrain and the skybox.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/terrain.png" class="d-block w-70">
                <br>
              <p>The main area of the scene consists of a flat, sandy terrain, which is a
                collideable mesh where the gameplay takes place. This area is decorated with
                cacti plants around the edges, which are flat png sprites that are randomly
                generated within a set range of coordinates upon the scene's startup.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/cacti.png" class="d-block w-70">
                <img src="public/docpics/cactipic.png" class="d-block w-70">
                <br>
                <br>
              <h2>Arena</h2>
              <p>In the center of the sandy terrain is the arena, where the gameplay takes place.
                It is a rectangular area made up of walls, that contains obstacles and the goal,
                and is where the player and ball will spawn upon the scene's startup.</p>
                <br>
              <h2>Walls</h2>
              <p>The arena consists of two walls, both of them cloned and repositioned to create
                the 4 walls of the arena that surround the player. The walls all have the same
                yellow and black warning hazard texture applied to them, to signify that they are
                bounds of the arena.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/walls.png" class="d-block w-70">
                <img src="public/docpics/wallspic.png" class="d-block w-100">
                <br>
                <br>
              <h2>Obstacles</h2>
              <p>Inside the arena are four large immovable boxes, that act as the obstacles the
                player must push the ball around during gameplay. These are simple box meshes,
                with the same yellow and black hazard texture applied to them, to keep them
                aesthetically matching with the immovable walls.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/obstacles.png" class="d-block w-70">
                <img src="public/docpics/obstaclespic.png" class="d-block w-60">
                <br>
                <br>
              <h2>Goal</h2>
              <p>The goal is a long rectangular box mesh with a transparent net texture applied to it,
                looking much like a metal wire fence. The goal has no mesh applied and both the
                player and ball can move straight through it.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/goalpic.png" class="d-block w-50">
                <br>
                <br>
              <h2>Game Objects</h2>
              <h2>Player Character</h2>
              <p>The player character is a blue dummy model that is controlled by the player using
                the WASD keyboard buttons. The character can walk, rotate, moonwalk and sprint.</p>
                <img src="public/docpics/playerpic.png" class="d-block w-50">
                <br>
                <p>The character has a capsule collider on it's mesh, which is used to collide with
                  the ground and environment objects. The character's mesh has a mass of 10 applied
                  to it, which allows it to push the lighter ball around the arena. The character
                  has both walking and idle animations that play and stop when appropriate.</p>
                  <img src="public/docpics/player1.png" class="d-block w-50">
                  <br>
                  <img src="public/docpics/player2.png" class="d-block w-50">
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Ball</h2>
                  <p>The ball is the main object of the game, as it controls the win condition for
                    the player to complete the game. The ball is a simple white sphere object, with
                    a sphere collider applied and a mass of 2, making it lighter than the player
                    character and easily pushed around.
                    The ball also collides with everything in the scene except the goal. When the
                    ball's mesh intersects with the goal's mesh, this triggers the game's win
                    condition and the scene progresses to the win screen.</p>
                    <img src="public/docpics/ball.png" class="d-block w-40">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h1>Win Screen</h1>
                    <p>When the player has succesfully pushed the ball into the goal, the gameplay
                      scene transitions to this screen. This screen is just a camera shot of the
                      skybox, with cenetered UI text that lets the player know they have completed
                      the game, and tells them how to return to the main menu.</p>
